## 🔬 Core Research Focus

Our work is divided into specialized labs, ensuring a modular approach to telecommunications security:

### 📡 Network & Signaling
- **Core Network Security**: SS7, Diameter, and 5G SBA protocol testing.
- **RAN Security**: O-RAN architectures and air interface vulnerabilities.
- **SIM/eSIM**: Profile management and remote provisioning security.

### 📱 Device & Operating Systems
- **Baseband Research**: Firmware analysis and RIL/QMI vulnerabilities.
- **TEE Security**: TrustZone analysis and secure boot auditing.
